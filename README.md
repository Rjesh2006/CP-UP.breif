# [Here we will understand whats the control plane and user plane exactly in well defined way :-]()
   - ## Also we will  learn waht's( UP and CP plane ) in 5G networking 

# plane in networking:- 
 - in networking , a plane is not a physicl component but an intangible idea that helps concenptualize traffic flows through a network  it refers to a part of the physical network architecture or an area of opereation where certain activities and processes take place. The data plane, the control plane and the management plane are the three basic components of a telecommunications architecture.


## User plane : - 
in short term we can say that 
the  date plane sometimes whiich  known as the user plane forwding plane ,carriers plane or bearer plane this is the part of network that carries (user traffic.)
 
 -The data plane controls all the functions and processes that determine how to 
  forward packets from one interface to another.
    







## Control  plane: -

   
-   The main function of the control plane is to create logic and to program actions 
    for the data plane Thus while the data plane actually forwards the packets, the 
    control plane determines or controls, how the packets should be forwarded.
